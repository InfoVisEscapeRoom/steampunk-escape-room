## Functionality 
The Steampunk Escape Room project is implemented as a static website, but it has several important functional features: 

* **Static website without a server component** All content is stored in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. No database or server is required for the site to work — it can be run locally or via GitHub Pages. 

* **Interactive pages for checking solutions** The pages allow users to check the correctness of their solutions. The logic is implemented via JavaScript: after entering the answer, the user receives confirmation of correctness or a hint. 

* **Thematic navigation between pages** The menu and buttons on the site allow you to quickly switch between the main page and verification pages. 

* **Adaptability** The site displays correctly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
