Functionality

important functional features:

Static website without a server component 
All content is stored in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
No database or server is required for the site to work — it can be run locally or via GitHub 
Pages. 
Interactive pages for checking solutions 
The pages puzzle-check_team1.html, puzzle-check_team2.html, and 
puzzle-check_team3.html allow users to check the correctness of their solutions or quest 
room tasks. 
The logic is implemented via JavaScript: after entering the answer, the user receives 
confirmation of correctness or a hint. 
Thematic navigation between pages 
The menu and buttons on the site allow you to quickly switch between the main page, 
templates, and verification pages. 
The navigation matches the steampunk style and supports the atmosphere of the quest. 
Graphics and styles to create atmosphere 
Special fonts, buttons, and decorative elements in the steampunk style are used. 
Images and backgrounds emphasize the atmosphere of the quest room and make the site 
visually appealing. 
Adaptability 
The site displays correctly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
